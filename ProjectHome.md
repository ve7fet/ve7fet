Scratch pad for code fragments and other projects I am playing with.


# Downloads #

I've created some packages for some of the stuff I have re-compiled. Here they are, use at your own risk.

I prefer to build packages to deploy software on my embedded devices (ALIX and Pi), rather than having to compile on-device (yuck). It makes installation much easier and consistent.

## LinuxRMS aka rmsgw ##

This is a packaged-up version of Hans-J. Barthen's (DL5DI) and Brian Eckerts (W3SG) LinuxRMS (rmsgw) software.
